Question 1

Question 2
"The install worked successfully! Congratulations!
You are seeing this page because DEBUG=True is in your settings file and you have not configured any URLs."

Question 3
when navigating to '/', it shows 404 Page not found, and some defined URLs
1. polls/
2. admin/

when navigating to 'polls/', it shows "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."

Question 4
It updates/creates the database schema according to the changes you made to models.py
Why? 
It is automatic, so you don't need to use SQL commands to update the schema of the database everytime you update the models.
It gurantees that the model and the schema are aligned.
Being able to track the history changes to the modles. If generates a folder that contains some files. 0001_initial.py tells you what the initial model looks like, and the following file will tell you the add/delete of a field.

Question 5
The munipulation of "Authentication and Authorization" and "polls".
In "polls", I can add or edit a question or a choice.

To get custom modles to appear in the Django admin page, you need to bind it to the admin but adding admin.site.register(/* model name */)


Question 6
"/polls/38/": "You're looking at question 38."
"/polls/38/results": "You're looking at the results of question 38."
"/polls/38/vote": "You're voting on question 38."

If I don't put a number, I'll 404 page not found.
Replace "int" with "str"

Question 7
It's flexible. Otherwise, if you chagne the url of a view, you will need to change everything that references to it.

Question 8
Generic view simplifies the steps to write the code. Take the DetailView as an example, you don't need to write code to get object from a model and call the render function to render by template, all you need to do is to specify some attributes such as model and template.
